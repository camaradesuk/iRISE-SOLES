### **Update**

### **01-04-24**

ML tested on ~3000 studies
Specificity: 0.69
Sensitivity: 0.95

### **09-05-24**

- Screening Complete

- ML performance on 5000 studies
Specificity: 0.72
Sensitivity: 0.95

- K-fold performance

Fold: 1
0.9578947
0.7583799

Fold: 2

- Slight improvement in ML on entire corpus. Very low specificity on folds 4 & 5 is concerning.

- Mean Specificity: 0.69
- Standard Deviation: 0.095

### Error Correction

- 1168 disagreements found between human and machine
- 67 included by human, excluded by machine
- 1101 excluded by human, included by machine

- Initial Error Correction started with 250 most extreme discrepancies.
- 67 included, 183 excluded by humans
- Hoping to improve specificity
