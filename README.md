# iRISE-SOLES
iRISE-SOLES is a part of an EU Consortium project, iRISE (improving Reproducibility in Science), which you can read more about [here](https://irise-project.eu/). Our aim for iRISE-SOLES is to systematically identify, synthesise and evaluate information on existing candidate interventions and tools to improve reproducibility. To do this, we have developed an integrated workflow of automated tools to collect and tag published research articles and visualise the evidence in this interactive web application. We tag studies by discipline, intervention, intervention provider, institution location, and reproducibility relevant outcomes. We also assess the transparency metrics of studies witin iRISE-SOLES e.g. their open access status and presence of data/code sharing.

The iRISE-SOLES web application is availabe [here](https://camarades.shinyapps.io/irise-soles/)
